# learning-resources

## All the resources I have been using to learn Machine Learning and Deep Learning in order.



### Machine Learning:
Beginners:
- [Intro to Machine Learning](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud120) - a very concise and enough to get started course
- [https://mlcourse.ai/](https://mlcourse.ai/) - perfect balance of theory and practice. 



### Calculus:
- [Calculus Made Easy by Silvanus P. Thompson](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33283) - Calculus explained in very simple way - [2-3 days] read time if yoy don't intend to solve all the exercises


### Deep Learning:
- [Machine Learning & Deep Learning Fundamentals - by DeepLizard](https://deeplizard.com/learn/playlist/PLZbbT5o_s2xq7LwI2y8_QtvuXZedL6tQU) - One of the best and amazing courses [My Notes from this course - part 1](https://github.com/vipulrai91/tensorflow-projects/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/Deep%20Learning%20Notes.ipynb)[   part2](https://github.com/vipulrai91/tensorflow-projects/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/Deep%20Learning%20Notes-2.ipynb)



### Computer Vision:
- [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)
- [Deep Learning for Computer Vision ](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/)



### Books:
- Keras  [Deep Learning with Python, Second Edition](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition) - Very good book from the creator of Keras - Currently reading it
