## All the resources I have been using to learn Machine Learning and Deep Learning in order.


### Machine Learning:
Beginners:

- [https://mlcourse.ai/](https://mlcourse.ai/) - perfect balance of theory and practice. 


### Calculus:
- [Calculus Made Easy by Silvanus P. Thompson](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33283) - Calculus explained in very simple way - [2-3 days] read time if yoy don't intend to solve all the exercises
